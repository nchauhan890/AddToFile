1.0.4
-----

- Added show_containing_folder setting which shows only the containing folder
  instead of the full file path. (Overrides show_file_path setting.)
- Added smart_add_to command which shows a folder name in brackets if there
  are 2 conflicting file paths in the file selection panel.
- Added auto_smart command which causes smart_add_to to be run automatically
  instead of add_to.
