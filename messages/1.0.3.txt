1.0.3
-----

- added show_popup setting to show a popup at the cursor instead of
  a selection panel
- added change_preview and get_preview commands (inaccessible by user) to set
  which 3 lines are shown in the file selection panel - custom setting is valid
  per view and resets once the view is closed. (Commands can be accessed
  through the command palette):
    - change_preview corresponds to Set preview lines in the command palette
      which will set the lines to be previewed to the 3 lines starting at where
      the first cursor currently is.
    - get_preview corresponds to Show preview lines in the command palette
      which will scroll the current view to show the lines which will be
      previewed. By default the first 3 lines of the file is the preview if no
      custom preview has been set for the view. Not an entirely useful command,
      but it may have a use.
- added documentation/docstrings into AddToFile.py to ease
  debugging and readability
